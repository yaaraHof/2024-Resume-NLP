# 2024-Resume-NLP
In this project I practice NLP techniques in learning and extracting information from a resume dataset.

Dataset from Keggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehaanbhawal/resume-dataset

The Data is saved in the "dataset" folder in this repo.
Other files:
- preprocess.py: implements basic preprocessing on Resume.csv
- EDA.ipynb: exploratory data analysis and further processing of the data. Saved as a jupyter notebook to display progress.
- model.ipynb: running several models on the data, displaying the results, and saving them as new csv files to the "classification_report" folder.
- output_analysis.ipynb: visualize the different results.
